Question 3

In Inheritance concept which of the following members of base class are accesible to derived class members. Explain the answer.
	1. static
	2. protected
	3. private
	4. shared

Answer:
	Out of those, only protected members of base class are accesible to derived class members, the reason is due to the
	level of protection:
	Public - Accesed by everyone
	Privated - Accesed only in the same struct or class
	Protected - Accesed only in the same struct or class AND by its derived class members
	Shared - Does not exist
	Static - Makes a variable, class or method unable to be instanciated, so it does not allow access from derived class
	members.
